🌿🛡️ Apprentice of Code | Architect of Fantasy
I’m a game developer in the making — a dreamer who weaves dragons 🐉, dungeons 🏰, and destiny into lines of logic and light 💻✨.

🧪 Fueled by curiosity and caffeine ☕, I conjure experiences with C++, Python, and Unreal Engine, breathing life into forgotten realms and digital legends.
Every bracket, every function, every bug I slay is a step closer to a world yet unseen 🌌.

🌱 My code grows like ancient vines — tangled, mystical, and rooted in storytelling 🍃. I shape immersive quests where shadows move, swords clash ⚔️, and magic glows softly in the dark ✨🕯️.

🎮 Whether it’s crafting pixel-perfect potions, coding AI for mythical creatures 🦄, or engineering soundscapes in cursed forests 🌲🔊 — I’m building games that feel alive.

📜 This isn’t just development.
It’s digital spellcraft.
It’s narrative engineering.
It’s turning imagination into interaction 🎭🧙‍♂️.
